        <h2>1. Our Vision: A Citadel for True Collectors</h2>
        <p>The world of digital collectibles is broken. The thrill of the drop has been replaced by the frustration of competing against automated bots. We believe that a collector's passion and patience should matter more than the speed of their script.</p>
        <p>This project is a movement, and The Sentry Sloth is our emblem. He represents what we stand for: vigilance, patience, and a deep appreciation for the art of collecting. Our mission is to build a community-first brand that rewards genuine enthusiasts by creating a launch process that is transparent, accessible, and, above all, fair.</p>

        <h2>2. The Genesis Collection</h2>
        <p>We are proud to introduce The Sentry Sloth Genesis Collection, a series of 5,555 unique digital collectibles built securely on the Cardano blockchain. Each piece is a high-quality work of art, designed to be a badge of honor for those who join our cause. These are more than profile pictures; they are the keys to our Citadel.</p>

        <h2>3. The "Proof-of-Patience" Fair Launch</h2>
        <p>Our launch will be a live demonstration of our values. The minting process is designed to be bot-resistant and reward our community. For details on how our "Citadel Gate" system works, please visit the "The Launch" section of our website.</p>

        <h2>4. The Roadmap</h2>
        <p>This is a long-term brand, not a short-term project. Our post-launch roadmap is focused on delivering sustained value to our holders and includes community building, brand expansion, and collaborations that align with our core mission.</p>
