                     Hello and welcome. This is The Sentry Sanctuary. It isn't a company with a complex roadmap; it's my personal art studio, a world I am building one sloth at a time. In an industry that prizes speed, I was inspired to create a "slow art" movementâ€”a project that values patience, craftsmanship, and a genuine connection. Every sloth you see is a unique, 1-of-1 piece of art, meticulously hand-crafted by me.
